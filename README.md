# 📘 Student Management System (Java)

A simple Java console application that demonstrates **inheritance**, **interfaces**, **method overloading/overriding**, and **polymorphism**, based on the assignment requirements.

---

## 📌 Features

### ✔ Add Student

Enter roll number, name, email, course, and marks.

### ✔ Delete Student

Removes a student by roll number.

### ✔ Update Student

Edits an existing student record.

### ✔ Search Student

Displays details of a single student.

### ✔ View All Students

Shows all stored student records.

### ✔ Grade Calculation

Grades are assigned automatically based on marks:

* **A** → 90+
* **B** → 75–89
* **C** → 60–74
* **D** → <60

## 🧰 Concepts Used

* **Abstract Class (Person)**
* **Inheritance (Student extends Person)**
* **Interface (RecordActions)**
* **Polymorphism (Dynamic Method Dispatch)**
* **Method Overloading and Overriding**
* **HashMap** for efficient student storage
